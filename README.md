## About
Open Antique Tuscan is a revival and expansion of an Antique Tuscan wood type design Wells & Webb 1849 specimens catalog. This was inspired by the book <a href="https://www.amazon.com/American-Wood-Type-1828-1900-Evolution/dp/0978588177">American Wood Type 1828â€“1900</a> by Rob Roy Kelly.

## How to Contribute to Open Antique Tuscan
This is not a completed typeface. While most of the glyphs are created there is still quite a bit of kerning, ligatures, and other opentype features I would like to implement.

##Feedback & Questions
If you have any questions or would like to provide feedback on the typeface (I would GREATLY appreciate all feedback) please email "design@nathandietz.com".
